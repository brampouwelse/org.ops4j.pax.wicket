pax-wicket-0.8.0 2012-02-06
--------------------------------------------

The 0.8.0 release is last (and final) feature release of the wicket 1.4.x series. All 
further bug-fixes and micro releases are done in micro release of the 0.8.x branch. 
The release fixes tons of bugs; upgrade to the latest wicket 1.4.x micro release (1.4.19);
upgrades the related dependencies (pax-web 1.0.8, karaf 2.2.5, slf4j 1.6.3, spring 3.0.7,
mockito 1.9.0, wiquery 1.2.4, ...); The most important features for the 0.8.x series are
a bundle-listener which decides automatically which bundles are to be included into an 
application making the registration of injection, mounting and class loading services no 
longer required; in addition the handling of injection handlers had been abstracted to be 
extendable now. Besides those direct API changes the entire documentation had been updated 
and completed. For almost every case an example had been added.
